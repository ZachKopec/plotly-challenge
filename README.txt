# plotly-challenge
Hw worked on with classmate William Roll.

Program takes in data from JSON file and creates web visualizations.
On site opening, program will display the data of the first available item of the dataset and provides information on the id of the subject in the form of text and graphs.
A dropdown menu is provided to switch the id of the subject and view their information in the form of the provided data upon opening.

Using javascript this application reads data and dynamically adds html elements to display it & provide meaningful analysis. D3 is used to manipulate the HTML to provide data that is not origanlly available to the HTML and Plotly is used to create the visualizations.
